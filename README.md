Porta - 1.0
Welcome to Porta, a 32-bit operating system that’s currently in its extremely early baby phase. This project is a personal side endeavor, created out of curiosity and a passion for low-level programming.

Disclaimer:
Porta is completely unfinished and should be considered a work in progress. It’s not intended for practical use, and basically no features exist or are practically non-functional. This is purely a learning project, but I’m excited to share its progress with anyone interested in OS development.

Current State:

    Basic 32-bit kernel
    Minimal hardware interaction
    Extremely limited functionality
    No user interface or applications

Goals for the Future:

    Improve stability and functionality
    Add basic system utilities
    Add a working task and executable system
    Make the filesystem (FAT32) work properly within a CLI-task

How to Contribute:
If you’re interested in contributing or just want to follow the development, feel free to check out the project repository and share your thoughts.
